<h1>Deep Neural Network - Colon Cancer Prediction via Image Recognition</h1>
<h2>Author: Joseph Waugh</h2>

This repository is the basis for a web framework used to predict colon cancer. Colon cancer is one of the leading causes of death via cancer in the United States, and about <a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/colon-rectal-cancer/about/key-statistics.html">~4% of men and women develop colon cancer throughout their lifetime</a>.
<br>
<br>
This repository contains the web framework via the Python library Flask, in addition to the neural network code developed via Tensorflow and Keras to provide a % likelihood of cancer via a user uploaded photo.
